# Latency checker
Holds code for running ping commands and formating the output for logging for the sake of measuring the latencies experienced by the system.

## Compiling:
Compile the file [latencyChecker.cpp](https://github.com/mantaur/iot/blob/main/latencyChecker/latencyChecker.cpp) with:
```bash
c++ latencyChecker.cpp -o latencyChecker.exe
```
(or any other cpp compiler of your choice)

## Product list
### * Computer
A Raspberry Pi 3 A + is used as the brains. (Used for other projects as well (see eg. [Automatic watering](https://github.com/mantaur/iot/blob/main/automaticWatering)), which is so nice about crontabs since a single chip can be used for multiple time based jobs).
